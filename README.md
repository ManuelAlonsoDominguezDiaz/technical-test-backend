# Wallets Service

I'll write here some info about my code test. Not all finished as I'd like, but enough I think. 
A bit more code testing and maybe another thought about folders will be good.
Also to add mappers (Orika or mapStruct, for example), validation, etc.

I haven't added javadoc, sorry, but you'll find some comments about some ideas to implement or to improve.

I've added a maven wrapper, so:

To Install:
./mvnw clean install

To boot up: ./mvnw spring-boot:run

It will boot up on localhost:8090.

I've also add Swagger-UI (2.0) to check easly the API.

And if you want to test it online. It's deployed on: *NOT DEPLOYED YET*
